Well, weekend 1 in Tornio is almost over... I can't say I have achived much, however it's been nice to relax and chill out in the apartment.

On saturday I thought I should have a bit of a look around. I was going to have a walk over to the Swedish side, however I thought I'd save that for another weekend, instead I had a walk around the stretch of land I am on... It took about 30 minutes, but it was a really nice day and I saw some nice sites even in the short walk I had. I got a few pics, of things I saw on the way, and the route is below.



Sunday consisted of doing nothing at all, in fact I still have not got up yet. I have been working and watching the Office US, so much funnier than the UK one, it helped me delay doing anything at all, and now it's thundering and raining, so I am not going to go out at all today :-)

Looking forward to work tomorrow, I will meet the guy who I will be working with for the next few weeks I am here for, and also have 1 or 2 more tours booked to see the rest of the site... Hopefully the meltshop and the hot roll mill... Which next to the Kemi mine, is the areas I really enjoy about the production of Stainless Steel.
